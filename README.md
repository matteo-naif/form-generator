# Form Generator

This is a react project with TypeScript that generate a form from an object.

The problem I tried to solve is create a form with a lot of fields ia a flexible way.

Repo: https://github.com/matteo-naif/form-generator

## Installation

Use the npm command to install dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the project
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Configuration object

The configuration object of the form is in the directory

`src/config/form`

### Validation

To validate fields I used the Yup object schema validation. [Read the doc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup).
